    """What happened? I made a mistake in a presentation at work and my boss noticed in front of everyone.

What emotions did I feel at the time? How intense were they?
Shame (9/10), embarrassment (8/10), anxiety (7/10).

What went through my mind?
"I'm incompetent. Everyone thinks I'm a fraud. I'm going to lose my job."

Facts that support this thought?
I did make an error. My boss did point it out in front of others.

Facts that provide evidence against this thought?
I've received positive feedback on my work many times before. One mistake doesn't define my entire performance. My boss has supported me in the past. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

What can be an alternative thought?
"I made a mistake today, which is human. I can learn from it, apologize if needed, and do better next time. My value as an employee isn't determined by one error."

How do I feel now?
Still a bit embarrassed (4/10) but much less anxious (3/10). I feel more able to move forward.""",

    """What happened? A friend didn't respond to my messages for three days.

What emotions did I feel at the time? How intense were they?
Hurt (7/10), worried (8/10), rejected (6/10).

What went through my mind?
"They're avoiding me. I must have done something wrong. Maybe they don't want to be friends anymore."

Facts that support this thought?
They did take a long time to respond. This is unusual for them.

Facts that provide evidence against this thought?
People get busy. They've been reliable in the past. I have no actual evidence I did something wrong. When they did respond, they explained they had been overwhelmed with family issues.

What can be an alternative thought?
"My friend was dealing with something difficult and it had nothing to do with me. I can check in with care rather than assuming the worst."

How do I feel now?
Much better. I'm going to reach out and ask how they're doing instead of spiraling.""",

    """What happened? I couldn't finish everything on my to-do list today.

What emotions did I feel at the time? How intense were they?
Failure (8/10), guilt (7/10), anxiety about tomorrow (6/10).

What went through my mind?
"I never get anything done. I'm so unproductive. I'm falling behind and it's only going to get worse."

Facts that support this thought?
There are unfinished tasks remaining. I started the day with a full list and didn't complete it all.

Facts that provide evidence against this thought?
I completed 7 out of 10 tasks — that's 70% completion. I had an unexpected two-hour meeting. I helped a colleague which was valuable. My to-do lists are often unrealistically long.

What can be an alternative thought?
"I accomplished a significant amount today while also adapting to unexpected demands. I can prioritize what carries forward to tomorrow. I am productive enough."

How do I feel now?
Still tired but no longer catastrophizing (2/10). Going to plan tomorrow's top 3 priorities and leave it at that.""",

    """What happened? I saw photos of friends having fun at a party I wasn't invited to.

What emotions did I feel at the time? How intense were they?
Hurt (8/10), left out (9/10), insecurity (7/10).

What went through my mind?
"Nobody really likes me. They have a whole life without me. I'm not important to them."

Facts that support this thought?
I wasn't included in this event. It looks like they had fun without me.

Facts that provide evidence against this thought?
I regularly spend time with these friends in other contexts. I wasn't invited because it was a separate work colleague's birthday party. People can have different social circles. I wasn't excluded maliciously.

What can be an alternative thought?
"My friends have full lives and different social circles, just as I do. Not being at every event doesn't mean I'm not valued. Our friendship is shown in many other ways."

How do I feel now?
Hurt reduced to about 3/10. I'm going to reach out to one of them to make plans, coming from a place of connection rather than insecurity.""",

    """What happened? I got critical feedback on a piece of work I was proud of.

What emotions did I feel at the time? How intense were they?
Disappointment (8/10), defensive (7/10), self-doubt (9/10).

What went through my mind?
"All my effort was worthless. I clearly don't know what I'm doing. I'll never be good enough."

Facts that support this thought?
The feedback pointed out real weaknesses in my work.

Facts that provide evidence against this thought?
Feedback is meant to help me grow, not to define my worth. I have received praise on past work. Even experts get critiques. The person giving feedback acknowledged the strengths too, which I almost ignored.

What can be an alternative thought?
"Getting detailed feedback means someone took my work seriously enough to engage with it deeply. I can use this to improve. Growth requires being willing to hear hard truths."

How do I feel now?
Disappointment down to 4/10. I'm going to read the feedback again tomorrow with fresh eyes and make a plan for revision.""",
